#=================================== Usage ===================================#

Open up Matlab and add the directory this README is in to your path.  You
should now be able to access ros.Bag, a Matlab class which can read ROS
messages on topics from a bag and return them as structs.  Multiple messages
are returned as cell arrays.  It's also possible to access some meta-data
(e.g., topic, msg type).  To get an idea of how the code works go to the
example directory and look at example.m and example.bag.

The fields in the structs are guaranteed to be in the same order as they are in
the message definition.  There are also some utilities for converting messages
from structs to matrices.

#========================== Ubuntu Later than 10.04 ==========================#

Matlab ships with an old version of the C++ standard library that you'll need
to get rid of if you use a version of Ubuntu after 10.04.  To do this, quit
Matlab and follow these steps from the command line:

    cd /usr/local/MATLAB/<version>/sys/os/<system>
    mkdir backup
    mv libstdc++* backup

Start Matlab up again and things should work.
